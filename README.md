### Project Title: Restaurant Revenue Prediction with Machine Learning

### Description:

Welcome to the "Restaurant Revenue Prediction" project, where we employ machine learning to forecast the revenue of a restaurant based on a dataset rich in various features. This project aims to empower restaurant owners and stakeholders with accurate revenue forecasts, aiding in decision-making and operational planning.

### Key Objectives:

Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting restaurant revenue.
Utilize a comprehensive dataset with various features, including location, menu offerings, and customer reviews.
Provide restaurant owners with actionable insights for optimizing their operations and enhancing profitability.
Promote data-driven strategies for the restaurant industry to thrive in a competitive market.

### Technologies Used:

Python
Jupyter Notebooks
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
Data Analysis (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Git for version control

### Project Structure:

Data: The restaurant dataset containing features for revenue prediction.
